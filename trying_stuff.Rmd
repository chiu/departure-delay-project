## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
DF <- data.frame(x = letters[1:5], y = 1:5, z = LETTERS[1:5], 
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(DF)
# 'data.frame':  5 obs. of  3 variables:
#  $ x: chr  "a" "b" "c" "d" ...
#  $ y: int  1 2 3 4 5
#  $ z: chr  "A" "B" "C" "D" ...

## The conversion
DF[sapply(DF, is.character)] <- lapply(DF[sapply(DF, is.character)], 
                                       as.factor)
str(DF)
# 'data.frame':  5 obs. of  3 variables:
#  $ x: Factor w/ 5 levels "a","b","c","d",..: 1 2 3 4 5
#  $ y: int  1 2 3 4 5
#  $ z: Factor w/ 5 levels "A","B","C","D",..: 1 2 3 4 5
```


# delete NA's

```{r}
## Some sample data
set.seed(0)
dat <- matrix(1:100, 10, 10)
dat[sample(1:100, 50)] <- NA
dat <- data.frame(dat)

## Remove columns with more than 50% NA
dat[, -which(colMeans(is.na(dat)) > 0.5)]
```

# Methods 
## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include the following:
- Dropping columns that contain data from after the planes' departure which may leak information about the response variable dep_delay.
- Dropping columns with too many NAs.
- Impute NAs for the remaining columns. 
- Scaling the data to work well with methods like lasso regression.


## - Dropping columns that contain data from after the planes' departure which may leak information about the response variable dep_delay.

dropping the columns "dep_time", "arr_time", "air_time", "arr_delay", because that leaks the response variable. 
dropping column  "year.x" because all the values are 2013
dropping tailnum because it produces too many dummy variable columns for one hot encoding.

```

Here, you can see the relative influence for each variable for gbm.  
For a gbm, the improvement in the splitting criterion (which is mean squared error for regression) for a given variable is calculated at each step.
The relative influence for a given variable is the average of these improvements over all the trees where the aforementioned variable is used.



```{r}
model <- gbm(dep_delay ~ ., data=train_df,
              n.trees=1000, shrinkage=0.01) # default shrinkage = 0.1
preds = predict(model, newdata=test_df, n.trees=1000)
rmse = sqrt(mean((test_df$dep_delay - preds)^2))

    dep_delay ~ .,
    data = train_df,
    n.trees = val,
    distribution = 'gaussian',

  preds = predict(hboost, n.trees = val, newdata = test_df)

  rmse <- sqrt(mse)
  rmse_vec[count] <- rmse
 
  print(val)
  print(rmse)
  count = count + 1

Tuning gbm
![alt text here](0point01_shrinkage_gbm_rmse_vs_num_trees.png)

Here I plotted root mean squared error (rmse) vs the number of trees for shrinkage of 0.01 and all other variables as default for gbm. 
You can see that after around 5000 trees, increasing the number of trees further gives diminishing returns.

#Methods:

## Data Preprocessing
I performed data preprocessing. 
My data preprocessing steps include the following:
- Dropping columns that contain data from after the planes' departure which may leak information about the response variable dep_delay.
- Dropping columns with too many NAs.
- Impute NAs for the remaining columns. 
- Scaling the data to work well with methods like lasso regression.
- Only kept data which had a departure delay of less than 30 minutes late, which reduced the dataset from 200,000 rows to approximately 170,000. 

## Modelling

Initially, I used the most basic cross validation technique where I have a training dataset and a holdout test dataset. I split the original data into a ratio of 2/3 train and 1/3 of the data for test.  I believe that this split gives enough data for the models to learn while 1/3 is enough data for me to get an accurate assessment of the error. k-folds cross validation was not initially used in order to save on compute time as I was only exploring the models. k-folds cross validation would increase training time for the models by a factor of k.

# Basic Models
dep_delay is the number of minutes that the plane either departs early or late.  Negative numbers are for early departures and positive numbers are for the number of minutes the plane is late.
First, I used a basic model of simply predicting the dep_delay to always be 0. This was done to establish baseline performance.  
This model had an root mean squared error (RMSE) of 8.30571. TODO
The model in which I predicted the mean for all the predictions had an RMSE of    TODO. 

# Linear Regression
Then I tried linear regression with dep_delay as the response variables and all the other remaining variables as the explanatory variables.
This model was better than predicting the mean with an RMSE of TODO. 
This suggests that there is some relationship between the dep_delay and the explanatory variables. 

# GBM
Aftewards, I tried a Generalized Boosted Regression Model (GBM).  This model had the lowest RMSE on the test dataset after I tuned it to have a shrinkage of 0.01 and around 16,000 trees.  Shrinkage is proportional to the learning rate. 16,000 trees is the number of trees used in the model.  Each iteration uses 1 tree, so 16,000 trees also refers to the number of iterations. 
According to the vignette, the rmse can always be improved by decreasing shrinkage but this provides diminishing returns.  A good strategy would be to pick a small shrinkage that balances performance and compute time.  Then with this fixed shrinkage value, increase the number of trees until you get diminishing returns. 


# Analysis

In regression and gbm, I found different features to be important.  For the best gbm model, dest which refers to which airport a given plane is going to was the most important feature. However, the one hot encoding versions of carrier were the most important features for regression.  On the other hand, dest does appear as an important feature in linear regression as well but it is not the most important feature.  I surmise that if we can somehow sum up all the contributions from each of the one hot encoded variables derived from dest then, it might appear as the most important feature for linear regression as well. We can try Anova in order to measure the statistical significance of dest. Performing anova on comparing linear regression model with and without dest, it was determined that due to the low p-value of 0.0001863 associated with having dest that keeping at least one of the one hot categorical variables derived from dest is beneficial for the linear regression model. 


TODO: try interaction terms , try anova. 


# Basic

Conclusion:
In conclusion, out of the methods that we covered in class, I found gradient boosted models to provide the best performance based on having the lowest root mean squared error on the hold out test set.

Based on the relative influence scores provided by the gbm, some of the most important feature variables include dest, model, and sched_dep_time_num_minute.

The dest column contains the airport code for where a given flight is flying to.
Based on my run of gbm with a shrinkage of 0.01 and 16834 trees, dest was the most important feature with 49.56 relative influence.[@uc_influence].


TODO; think about removing points that are outliers aka points with high cook's distance
consider removing outliers in train but not in test, then use k-folds cross validation on test.

TODO: remove points that are outliers ie dep_delay > 200 or 300 etc. or remove less than x number of points.
then use k-folds cross validation on cross validation set where no points were removed. 
can repeat k-folds for different seeds. 
can just try this on my quickest model, ie linear regression. 
should be bowl shape vs rmse vs. number of points removed.  theoretically

I also considered removing based on cook's distance but this took too long to compute.
